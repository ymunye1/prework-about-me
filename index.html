      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a software developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always seen myself as a problem slover and I
        love to create things and see my work come to life.
        I love a challage. The feeling I get when I accomplish a 
         challanging task. I love learning and using my mind. 
         There is also the ability to work for yourself as an 
         option which I find really neat. All that is needed is 
         one good idea and you have the power to impact thousands
         lives. The freedom, flexability and possibility are endless.
